        <p>This is a Website for a school project. It is not production ready and if it were to be needed in produciton I wouldn't recommend using this since it is very unsecure and functionality is only made for testing purposes. This website should be a interactive Timetable for Teachers and Students with a basic Login System. For this project login is done locally with one user Username:&nbsp;'test' Password:&nbsp;'test'. FYI: No Framework is used for this website everything is selfmade or rewritten by me. Enjoy your stay on this website&nbsp;/&nbsp;web&nbsp;application.</p>\
